# NHM-Collections
A project for fun to show the current composition of the NHM collections, their place of origin and internal departmental ratings of collection digitisation

This project is an example of my ability to explore a dataset, manipulate and clean the data for analysis, and use Excel to create a dashboard and report.
The original dataset is the publically available Join the Dots collection level records at https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/join-the-dots-collection-level-descriptions which is also in the repository as ‘resource (original).csv’

Prior to cleaning the data, I thought in advance of the data visualisations I wanted to show and the data I would need for this. More details about steps I took when cleaning, manipulating and validating data are in the appendix.
With the use of Pivot tables, I then created a dashboard showing the current composition of digitised NHM collection records by department and their continent of origin. It also visualises how divisions rate the current quality of their collections’ digitised records and their confidence in the accuracy of their reported counts.

Insights from these visualisations are helpful for identifying divisions to prioritise prior to the next annual specimen collection in checking if the current collection templates meet their needs and what updates could help

Caveats to this data are that its original dataset is less accurate as it is intended as a discovery tool and indicative view of the museum’s collections rather than an in depth record. In calculating the sites of origin of the collection, the majority of the data was blank (64% had no geographic origin recorded) and so the current composition of sites of origin is likely inaccurate.
